## Installation

[Include instructions on how to install your package.]

To use these digital signal processing algorithms in your C# project, you can either:

1. **NuGet Package (Recommended)**

   You can install the package via NuGet:

   ```bash
   Install-Package YourPackageName
   ```

   Or add it to your `.csproj` file:

   ```xml
   <PackageReference Include="YourPackageName" Version="X.Y.Z" />
   ```

2. **Manual Download**

   You can also download the source code from this repository and include the necessary files directly in your project.

## Usage

[Provide examples and usage instructions for your package.]

To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using DSPAlgorithms;
```

Here's an example of how to use the `DiscreteFourierTransform` class to perform a Discrete Fourier Transform on a signal:

```csharp
double[] inputSignal = new double[] { /* Your input signal data here */ };
DiscreteFourierTransform dft = new DiscreteFourierTransform(inputSignal);
double[] frequencySpectrum = dft.Compute();
```

Please refer to the specific class documentation and comments for more information on how to use each algorithm effectively.
